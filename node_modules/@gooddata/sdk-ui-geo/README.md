# GoodData.UI SDK - Geo Charts

This package provides the components that you can use to visualize location-based data.

Currently, only the [GeoPushpinChart](https://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui/docs/geo_pushpin_chart_component.html) component is available. Use this component to visualize data bound to a single location (not an area).

#### Internet Explorer

With GoodData.UI SDK version >=8.8, Geo Pushpin Chart is no longer supported in Internet Explorer 11.
